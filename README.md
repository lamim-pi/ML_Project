# Regression Experiment

## Project Overview

🎉 **My First Machine Learning Model!**  

I'm currently in class 10, and today, I built my very first machine learning model! This experiment explores how **Linear Regression** detects patterns in structured data.  

The model is trained on a dataset where `y` follows a specific step-wise pattern based on `x`. The goal is to see if the model can successfully learn this pattern or struggle with its limitations.

## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### 2. Run the Script
```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Enter a Number
The model will predict the output based on the learned pattern.

## Future Enhancements

✅ **Try Decision Trees** – Can they capture the pattern better?  
✅ **Add Visualization** – A graph to compare predictions vs. actual data.  
✅ **Experiment with Non-Linear Models** – How do they perform?

## 📝 Future Note  

👋 **Hey Future Me!**  

If you're reading this years later...  

Do you remember today? The day you created your **first-ever ML model!** 🎯  
Fast forward 5-10 years—how far have you come?  

### Some Questions to Ask Yourself:  

🔹 How much have your coding skills improved since today?  
🔹 Do you know more than just ML? (RL, AI Ethics, etc.)  
🔹 How do you look back at the mistakes in your first model?  
🔹 Are you running an AI startup or working at a big tech company?  
🔹 **Most importantly—are you still learning, experimenting, and having fun?**  

If **YES**, you're on the right track! 🔥🚀  
If **NO**, remember the excitement you felt building this first model! 😃
